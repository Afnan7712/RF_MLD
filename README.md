# AutoScout Race Project

## Overview

Welcome to the AutoScout Race project! This project is the result of my work in the Saudi Digital Academy's collaborative bootcamp with Clarusway. 
AutoScout Race is a machine learning model designed to predict the car's price.

## Project Structure

- **final_scout_not_dummy.csv** This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **rf2_model** Here, you can find the trained machine learning model.
- **MLD_RF.ipynb:** The source code for the AutoScout Race project, including data preprocessing, model development, and the Streamlit app.
- **model_RF_2.py:** The main application file for deploying the model with Streamlit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- streamlit
- pickle
- sklearn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone (https://github.com/Afnan7712/RF_MLD.git)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd RF_MLD`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run model_RF_2.py`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project.
